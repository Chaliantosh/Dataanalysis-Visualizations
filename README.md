This Repository has the ML use cases on all the Machine Learning steps such as leveraging linear regression, logistic regression, Decision trees, ensemble algorithms such as (Random Forests, boosting and bagging algorithms) etc.
   ---> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
   ---> Data Vizualtions (Histograms, Scatter plots, Box plots etc) 
   ---> Data preprocessing
   ---> Train test split
   ---> Fit the algorithm on the training data
   ---> Score the algorithm for regression
   ---> Classification report for classification
   ---> Confusion matrix
